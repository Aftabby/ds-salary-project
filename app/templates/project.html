    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            Welcome! This project involves a <strong>comprehensive analysis of data scientist job listings </strong> scraped from <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/">Glassdoor</a>.
            Initially, raw data was collected, capturing every possible detail about the job listings, followed by <mark>data cleaning</mark> and <mark>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</mark>, including feature encoding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Several <mark>predictive models</mark> were applied, including
        <ul>
            <li>Linear Regression</li>
            <li>Lasso Regression </li>
            <li>Random Forest</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>Random Forest</code> model, which demonstrated the <strong>highest accuracy</strong>, was selected.
        </p>
        <p>
            To showcase the results, a <mark>web application</mark> was developed using <mark>Flask</mark> and deployed within a <mark>Docker</mark> container. All project files and detailed documentation are available on my <a href="https://github.com/Aftabby/ds-salary-project">GitHub profile</a>.

    <h2>2. Problem Statement</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            Understanding job market trends for <strong>Data Scientist</strong> roles is crucial for both job seekers and employers.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project aims to address the following key questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identifying Key Influencers:</strong> What factors
                (such as, <mark>location</mark>, required <mark>skills</mark>, <mark>company size</mark>, and <mark>industry</mark> etc.)
                influence salary estimates for Data Scientist roles?</li>
            <li> <strong>Analyzing Salary Variations:</strong> How do <mark>company size</mark>, <mark>location</mark>, and <mark>industry</mark> correlate with job salary variations?</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Most Demanding Skill:</strong>
                Which <strong>skills</strong> and <strong>qualifications</strong> are most frequently listed in high-paying job postings?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Predictive Modeling:</strong> Can we build a <em>predictive model</em> to estimate salaries based on job features?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong> Interactive Visualization:</strong> Visualing the data in an interactive manner using <code>Power BI</code> Dashboard.
            </li>
        </ul>
